## Introduction

[Github](https://github.com> "Github") provides free hosting of a static website for each user and for each project. These websites are generated using [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll "Jekyll at Github") which will process all files uploaded to an individual user account (master branch of a special repo named `USERNAME.github.io`) or any project repos with a `gh-pages` branch.

This short guide will walk through the steps in setting up of a local "Jekyll" installation so that the website can be designed and its content reviewed before committing to Github.

## Requirements

* [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/> "Jekyll Installation Requirements")
    + ruby + rubygems
    + nodejs
    + python
* [Git](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/> "Set up Git")
* [Bundler](http://bundler.io/> "Bundler Install")

## Considerations

- In configuring Jekyll, it is important to bear in mind that Github's user page is located at root (USERNAME.github.io) while its project page is served from a sub-directory (USERNAME.github.io/NAME_OF_REPO). The parameter `baseurl` in `_config.yml` should be set correspondingly as follow:
    * an empty string `""` for a user page and 
    * `"/NAME_OF_REPO"` for a project page
- To preview the project website locally, it is necessary to temporarily override the baseurl setting using `jekyll serve --baseurl ""` so that the pages can be found at "localhost:4000".

---

## Considerations (cont)

- The Jekyll engine at Github only supports a selected set of plugins and it may not be the same version as the local installation. To avoid possible conflicts, put
`gem 'github-pages'` in a `Gemfile` in the repo's root directory followed by a command `bundle install`.
- Put `_site` into `.gitignore`. The folder is generated for the local Jekyll installation only. Jekyll will re-build the site every time following a new upload or commit.

---

## Creating Project Pages

* Clone an existing repo
    - `$ git clone github.com/user/repo.git`
* Create and switch to gh-pages branch
    - `$ cd repo`
    - `$ git checkout --orphan gh-pages`
* Remove all existing files
    - `$ git rm -rf .`

---

## Creating Project Pages (cont)

* Scaffold new Jekyll site
    - `$ jekyll new .`
* Make changes and create content
* Publish to Github
    - `$ git commit -am "new content added"`
    - `$ git push origin gh-pages`
